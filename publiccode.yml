    longDescription: |
      This is a template project containing 'Community Health  Files' and relevant
      checklists. Its intention is to be a practical starter when releasing a
      project as  Open Source. It was created in a general way to be usable for
      anyone, and proposes  well known conventions and de-facto standards when
      possible. However, It is slightly opinionated, so adjust it to suit your
      specific  needs. Or even:


      **You **_**are supposed**_** to adjust the contents and suggestions to
      suit your project needs.          **
